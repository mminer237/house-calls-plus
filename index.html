		<li>
			<h4>Living with Diabetes</h4>
			<p>This forum is largely for those newly diagnosed with diabetes, or those that have been told they may need to be on some form of medication for the rest of their life because they no longer produce insulin. I have grouped you together because I feel these two groups are the most creative or should allow for the most creativity. The newcomer because you need to explore options in both getting your diabetes under control and exploring the ideas of removing your diabetic label through diet and exercise or implementation of creative devices which healthily lower your blood sugars. The seasoned diabetic fits into this category because your life more than ever requires creativity. Putting a new spin on recipes, finding out that I enjoy yoga, or rock climbing, which lowers my HgA1c to my desired goals.</p>
